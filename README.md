# IKEA DIRIGERA Client

A client library and CLI for the IKEA DIRIGERA Smart-Home-Hub. This library is an unofficial implementation
in Go based on reverse engineering and is not affiliated with IKEA of Sweden AB! Future firmware updates may
therefore lead to incompatibility.

The current version is work in progress that does not cover all functions and has not been fully tested.
**Use this library at your own risk!**
